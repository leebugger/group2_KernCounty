              <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555;"> This scatterplot compares California counties by percentage of uninsured residents 
                and average number of mentally unhealthy days. Kern County, marked in red, falls above the state average in both metrics thus highlighting
                 a potential link between limited insurance coverage and mental health challenges.

              <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #555;"> This bar graph breaks down the types of licensed healthcare facilities in Kern County. While general 
                acute care hospitals and home health agencies are the majority, there is a noticeable shortage of specialized care facilities like psychiatric 
                hospitals and rehabilitation clinics. This showcases key gaps in the mental and long-term health service infrastructure within Kern County and 
                where they can improve next.
