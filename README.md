This project was developed as part of our Data Science capstone project at Stanford University, focused on regional economic analysis using geospatial data. 
The goal of the project is to communicate Kern County's economic landscape in a clear, engaging, and accessible way using front-end web technologies to hopefully
pair with their existing dashboard.

## Project Description

Kern County, located in California’s Central Valley, plays a crucial role in the state’s economy through its leadership in agriculture, energy, tourism, and healthcare.
Our website explores these industries using visualizations, embedded maps, and narrative content.

The site is designed to answer a guiding question:  
**“Why do business in Kern County?”**

To address this, we combined spatial analysis, census-tract-level data, and industry-level insights to create an online resource that:
- Highlights where economic activity is concentrated
- Shows gaps and opportunities in infrastructure
- Provides a clean, narrative-driven explanation for policymakers, businesses, and residents
